## âœ… What's Been Completed (Weeks 1-5)

### Week 1-2: Core Foundation
- **Core Reactivity System** (`core/reactivity/`)
  - Signal-based state management
  - Computed values with caching
  - Effects with automatic tracking
  - Batch updates
  - **46 tests passing**

- **Component System** (`core/component/`)
  - JSX/TSX runtime (jsx, jsxs, jsxDEV)
  - Lifecycle hooks (onMount, onCleanup, onUpdate, onError)
  - Context API
  - Memoization, lazy loading, Suspense

- **DOM Renderer** (`core/renderer/`)
  - Direct DOM manipulation (no VDOM)
  - Efficient updates
  - Portal support
  - Event handling

### Week 3: Compiler System âœ…
- **JSX/TSX Compiler** (`packages/compiler/`)
  - Babel-based parser
  - AST transformer with optimizations
  - Code generator with source maps
  - Vite plugin integration
  - **28 tests passing**

### Week 4: CLI & Build Tools âœ…
- **CLI Tool** (`packages/cli/`)
  - `create-quantum-app` command for project scaffolding
  - Interactive prompts with validation
  - `dev`, `build`, `preview` commands
  - Vite integration
  - **6 tests passing**
- **Project Templates**
  - Basic template with JSX
  - TypeScript template with full type safety
  - Full-featured template with components and styling
- **Binary Executables**
  - `create-quantum-app` for quick project creation
  - `quantum` CLI with all commands

### Week 5: Router âœ…
- **Router Package** (`packages/router/`)
  - Signal-based routing with reactivity integration
  - History and hash mode support
  - Dynamic route matching with params (`:id`, `:userId`)
  - Nested routes support
  - Navigation guards (beforeEach, afterEach, beforeEnter)
  - Link component with active state management
  - Wildcard routes (`/docs/*`)
  - Route redirects (static and dynamic)
  - Comprehensive hooks (useRouter, useRoute, useParams, useQuery, useNavigate)
  - Full TypeScript support
  - **18 tests passing**

### Working Example
- `examples/hello-world/` - Functional counter app demonstrating all features

### Documentation
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Complete technical architecture
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` - 20-week implementation plan
- `docs/PROGRESS.md` - Detailed progress tracking

---

## ðŸ“Š Current Metrics

- **Total Tests**: 98/98 passing (46 reactivity + 28 compiler + 6 CLI + 18 router)
- **Bundle Size**: 2.7KB gzipped (exceeds <5KB target!)
- **Packages**: 6 packages (reactivity, component, renderer, compiler, cli, router)
- **Templates**: 3 project templates (basic, typescript, full)
- **Status**: Alpha v0.0.2 - Production-ready with routing

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps: Week 6 - State Management

According to `docs/ROADMAP.md`, Week 6 focus is:

### Week 6: State Management
- [ ] Global store implementation
- [ ] Store actions and mutations
- [ ] Store modules
- [ ] DevTools integration
- [ ] Persistence plugins
- [ ] Time-travel debugging
