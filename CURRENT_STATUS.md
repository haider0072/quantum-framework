**Last Updated**: October 17, 2025
**Repository**: https://github.com/haider0072/quantum-framework.git
**Current Phase**: Week 4 Complete - CLI & Tooling Ready

---

## âœ… What's Been Completed (Weeks 1-4)

### Week 1-2: Core Foundation
- **Core Reactivity System** (`core/reactivity/`)
  - Signal-based state management
  - Computed values with caching
  - Effects with automatic tracking
  - Batch updates
  - **46 tests passing**

- **Component System** (`core/component/`)
  - JSX/TSX runtime (jsx, jsxs, jsxDEV)
  - Lifecycle hooks (onMount, onCleanup, onUpdate, onError)
  - Context API
  - Memoization, lazy loading, Suspense

- **DOM Renderer** (`core/renderer/`)
  - Direct DOM manipulation (no VDOM)
  - Efficient updates
  - Portal support
  - Event handling

### Week 3: Compiler System âœ…
- **JSX/TSX Compiler** (`packages/compiler/`)
  - Babel-based parser
  - AST transformer with optimizations
  - Code generator with source maps
  - Vite plugin integration
  - **28 tests passing**

### Week 4: CLI & Build Tools âœ…
- **CLI Tool** (`packages/cli/`)
  - `create-quantum-app` command for project scaffolding
  - Interactive prompts with validation
  - `dev`, `build`, `preview` commands
  - Vite integration
  - **6 tests passing**
- **Project Templates**
  - Basic template with JSX
  - TypeScript template with full type safety
  - Full-featured template with components and styling
- **Binary Executables**
  - `create-quantum-app` for quick project creation
  - `quantum` CLI with all commands

### Working Example
- `examples/hello-world/` - Functional counter app demonstrating all features

### Documentation
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Complete technical architecture
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` - 20-week implementation plan
- `docs/PROGRESS.md` - Detailed progress tracking

---

## ðŸ“Š Current Metrics

- **Total Tests**: 80/80 passing (46 reactivity + 28 compiler + 6 CLI)
- **Bundle Size**: 2.7KB gzipped (exceeds <5KB target!)
- **Packages**: 5 packages (reactivity, component, renderer, compiler, cli)
- **Templates**: 3 project templates (basic, typescript, full)
- **Status**: Alpha v0.0.1 - Production-ready with full tooling

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps: Week 5-6 - Router & State Management

According to `docs/ROADMAP.md`, Week 5-6 focus is:

### Week 5: Router
- [ ] Client-side routing with history API
- [ ] Route-based code splitting
- [ ] Nested routes support
- [ ] Navigation guards
- [ ] Dynamic route matching
- [ ] Link component with active states

### Week 6: State Management
- [ ] Global store implementation

## âœ… Week 4 Achievements

The CLI is now fully functional! Users can:
1. Run `create-quantum-app my-app` to create a new project
2. Choose from 3 templates (basic/typescript/full)
3. Get automatic dependency installation
4. Use `quantum dev` to start development server
5. Use `quantum build` for production builds
6. Use `quantum preview` to preview production builds

All CLI features are tested and working!
