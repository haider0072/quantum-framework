# Quantum Framework

> The ultimate multi-platform frontend framework - extremely easy to use, high performance, and lightweight.

## Vision

Quantum Framework aims to be **the only framework you'll ever need** - combining:

- **Extreme Ease of Use**: Minimal boilerplate, intuitive API, zero configuration
- **High Performance**: Faster than React, Vue, and Svelte through compile-time optimizations
- **Ultra Lightweight**: Core bundle < 5KB gzipped
- **Complete Ecosystem**: Built-in routing, state management, styling, animations
- **True Multi-Platform**: Single codebase for Web, iOS, and Android

## Project Status

**Current Phase**: Foundation (Week 1-4)

This framework is in active development. See [ROADMAP.md](./docs/ROADMAP.md) for detailed implementation plan.

## Architecture

Quantum Framework is built on:

- **Signal-based Reactivity**: Fine-grained reactive system with zero VDOM overhead
- **Smart Compiler**: Compile-time optimizations for maximum performance
- **Multi-Platform Core**: Write once, deploy everywhere
- **Batteries Included**: Everything you need out of the box

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for complete technical details.
